## 🟢 Home Office Drug Design Newsletter 🟡

This repository contains code and analyses for my newsletter which explores computational methods that are useful in the biotechnology and pharma space. Currently, the newsletter is exploring the application of AI-driven methods to identify therapeutic targets using single-cell sequencing data from human patients.

Note: The code in this repository will not function independently, as the original datasets are not included, however, they are available publicly. Details regarding the data sets can be found in the newsletter.

## About the Newsletter

I select a disease and use publicly available datasets to propose potential treatments. This is a personal project and not connected to any organization.
