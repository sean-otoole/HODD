Home Office Drug Design Newsletter

This repository contains code and analyses for my newsletter on RNA therapeutics and computational drug design. The newsletter explores the application of AI-driven methods to identify therapeutic targets using single-cell sequencing data from human patients.

Note: This repository will not function independently, as the original datasets are not included for confidentiality reasons.

About the Newsletter

Each issue of the newsletter selects a disease with available single-cell sequencing data and applies AI-driven perturbational analysis to propose potential RNA therapeutic targets. The focus is on diseases with cell-autonomous pathology or uniform effects across all cell types to maintain analytical tractability.
