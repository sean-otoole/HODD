## Home Office Drug Design Newsletter

This repository contains code and analyses for my newsletter on RNA therapeutics and computational drug design. The newsletter explores the application of AI-driven methods to identify therapeutic targets using single-cell sequencing data from human patients.

Note: This repository will not function independently, as the original datasets are not included, however, they are available publicly.

# About the Newsletter

In the newsletter I select a disease and use publicly available datasets to propose potential treatments. This is a personal project and not connected to any organization.
